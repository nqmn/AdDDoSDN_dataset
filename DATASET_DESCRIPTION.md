# AdDDoSDN Dataset: Adversarial DDoS Attacks in Software-Defined Networks

The AdDDoSDN dataset is a comprehensive collection of network traffic data specifically designed for defensive security research in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments, capturing sophisticated DDoS attacks and normal network behavior through controlled experimentation using Mininet emulation and Ryu SDN controller to provide researchers with high-quality, labeled data for developing and evaluating DDoS detection systems. The dataset is generated using a carefully designed SDN topology consisting of six hosts connected through an OpenFlow 1.3 switch controlled by a Ryu controller, including two dedicated attackers (h1: 10.0.0.1, h2: 10.0.0.2), two normal traffic generators (h3: 10.0.0.3, h5: 10.0.0.5), and two victim servers (h4: 10.0.0.4, h6: 10.0.0.6), enabling realistic simulation of both attack and benign traffic patterns while maintaining complete observability through the centralized SDN controller.

The dataset follows a structured 7-phase attack sequence spanning approximately 6.5 hours per dataset generation cycle, with each phase representing a distinct traffic pattern including network initialization, normal traffic baseline (1 hour), enhanced SYN flood attack (5 minutes), enhanced UDP flood attack (5 minutes), enhanced ICMP flood attack (5 minutes), adversarial TCP state exhaustion (2 hours), adversarial application layer mimicry (80 minutes), and adversarial slow read attack (1 hour), ensuring comprehensive coverage of different attack vectors while maintaining realistic temporal patterns. The dataset uniquely differentiates between Enhanced Traditional attacks and Adversarial attacks, where Enhanced Traditional attacks incorporate human-like timing patterns (80-150ms intervals), protocol compliance (RFC-compliant TCP options, realistic DNS queries), and session modeling while maintaining detectability through rate-based rules (~25 packets/second), while Adversarial attacks focus on ML evasion techniques with low packet rates (~0.3 packets/second), IP rotation, burst patterns with jitter, and sophisticated mimicry techniques designed to bypass detection systems.

The dataset provides three synchronized data formats extracted from the same network traffic, each designed for different analysis approaches: packet-level data (178K records, 15 features) for real-time threat detection and protocol analysis with microsecond response times, SDN flow-level data (2.7M records, 18 features) for real-time controller-based monitoring and automated response actions with millisecond latency, and CICFlow aggregated data (34K records, 85 features) for offline behavioral analysis, forensic investigation, and advanced machine learning research requiring comprehensive statistical features computed over complete flow lifetimes. The dataset demonstrates exceptional quality with 98.9% labeling accuracy achieved through conservative data preservation techniques, containing 2.9 million total records across four dataset instances (1607-1, 1607-2, 1707-1, 1707-2), each representing different temporal scenarios spanning two consecutive days with seven distinct traffic types including normal traffic, SYN flood, UDP flood, ICMP flood, adversarial SYN, adversarial UDP, and adversarial slow attacks, while timeline integrity is maintained through attack.log synchronization ensuring precise temporal alignment between different data formats.

This dataset is specifically designed for defensive security research including DDoS detection algorithm development, SDN security analysis, adversarial attack detection, network traffic classification, and ML model evaluation, with the balanced representation of attack types, realistic timing patterns, and multi-granularity data collection making it particularly valuable for training robust detection systems capable of identifying both traditional high-rate attacks and sophisticated low-rate adversarial techniques, while the dataset's comprehensive labeling and conservative data preservation approach ensure reliability for academic research and security system development in SDN environments.
