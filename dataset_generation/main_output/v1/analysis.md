- **Features**: 15 packet-level attributes (timestamp, protocols, ports, flags)
- **Use Cases**: Packet classification, protocol analysis, real-time detection
- **Volume**: ~44,600 packets per dataset

#### 2. SDN Flow Data (`flow_features.csv`)

## Attack Scenario Design

### Multi-Day Attack Simulation

The framework implements a sophisticated **four-day attack simulation** with diverse timing patterns to enhance temporal robustness for ML training:

#### Temporal Distribution
- **Day 1 (July 16)**: Morning (1607-1) and Afternoon (1607-2) sequences
- **Day 2 (July 17)**: Late night (1707-1) and Morning (1707-2) sequences  
- **Day 3 (July 18)**: Afternoon sequence (1807-1)
- **Day 4 (July 19)**: Late night sequence (1907-1)

#### 7-Phase Attack Sequence
Each dataset follows a consistent attack pattern:

1. **Normal Traffic** (1 hour): Baseline network behavior
2. **SYN Flood** (5 minutes): TCP SYN flood at 22.5 pps
3. **UDP Flood** (5 minutes): UDP flood at 22.5 pps  
4. **ICMP Flood** (5 minutes): ICMP echo requests at 22.5 pps
5. **Adversarial SYN** (2 hours): TCP state exhaustion at ~0.3 pps with IP rotation
6. **Adversarial UDP** (1.33 hours): Application layer attacks at ~0.3 pps
7. **Adversarial Slow** (2 hours): Slow HTTP attacks at ~0.3 pps

### Attack Characteristics

#### Traditional High-Rate Attacks (Phases 2-4)
- **Purpose**: Easily detectable baseline attacks
- **Rate**: 22.5 packets/second  
- **Duration**: 5 minutes each
- **Targets**: Random ports and endpoints
- **Detection**: High-volume signatures

#### Adversarial Low-Rate Attacks (Phases 5-7)
- **Purpose**: ML evasion and sophisticated attack simulation
- **Rate**: ~0.3 packets/second (stealth rate)
- **Duration**: 1.33-2 hours each
- **Target**: 10.0.0.6:80 (HTTP service)
- **Techniques**: IP rotation, burst patterns, protocol compliance

- **Traditional attacks**: ~300s duration, <1s timing gaps
- **Adversarial attacks**: Expected durations with 5-22s acceptable variance
- **Timeline synchronization**: All formats aligned to attack.log boundaries

#### Target Validation: 100%
- **Adversarial attacks**: All target 10.0.0.6:80 (HTTP service)
- **IP rotation**: Proper source IP diversity from private subnets
- **Attack characteristics**: Validated against expected patterns

## Timeline Integrity Framework

### Conservative Data Preservation Approach

The framework implements a conservative approach to maintain data integrity while ensuring timeline consistency:

#### Core Principles
1. **Preserve All Existing Labels**: Never change correct existing classifications
2. **Fix Only Unknown Labels**: Address literal "unknown" labels based on timing + characteristics  
3. **Validate Before Reclassification**: Ensure packet characteristics match expected attack patterns
4. **Use Attack Logs as Ground Truth**: Timeline boundaries extracted from actual execution logs

#### Results Achieved
- **Historical Fixes**: 2,007 unknown labels fixed in initial processing
- **Current Unknown Labels**: 3,089 legitimate edge cases preserved
- **Data Preservation**: 0 records deleted (all within timeline boundaries)
- **Backup Management**: Automatic backup creation with integrity protection

### Edge Case Handling

The 3,089 remaining unknown labels represent legitimate edge cases:

1. **Timeline Gap Packets** (~10%): Transition periods between attack phases (7-13 seconds)
2. **Response Packets** (~90%): TCP RST+ACK responses FROM target TO attackers
   - Fail validation due to wrong direction (ip_dst ≠ '10.0.0.6')
   - Wrong ports (dst_port ≠ 80)

This demonstrates **correct conservative validation behavior** - rejecting packets that don't match expected attack characteristics rather than forcing incorrect labels.
