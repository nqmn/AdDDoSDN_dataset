### Advanced Adversarial Attacks

**Description:**
This category encompasses more sophisticated DDoS attacks designed to evade detection and mimic legitimate traffic patterns. They often involve IP address rotation, advanced packet crafting, and multi-vector approaches.

**Source:** `gen_advanced_adversarial_ddos_attacks.py`

#### 1. Advanced SYN Attack (TCP State Exhaustion)

**Description:**
This attack aims to exhaust the target's TCP connection state table by initiating many TCP handshakes but not completing them, similar to a SYN flood, but with more sophisticated manipulation of sequence numbers and window sizes to appear more legitimate and keep connections "half-open" for longer.

**How it happens in the scenario:**
- Uses an `IPRotator` to generate random source IP addresses, making it harder to block based on IP.
- Crafts TCP SYN packets with randomized sequence numbers, window sizes, and TTL (Time To Live) values.
- Sends SYN packets and attempts to receive SYN-ACK replies. If a SYN-ACK is received, an ACK packet is sent to establish a "half-open" connection, but no further data is exchanged, consuming server resources.
- Includes jitter in packet sending to avoid detection based on timing patterns.

    G -->|Yes| H[Attack Complete]
    
    style A fill:#fff3e0
    style H fill:#e8f5e8
```

#### 2. Advanced UDP Attack (Application Layer Mimicry)

**Description:**
This attack targets the application layer (e.g., HTTP) by sending legitimate-looking requests to resource-intensive endpoints on the victim server. The goal is to consume server processing power, database resources, or application-specific bandwidth rather than just network bandwidth.

**How it happens in the scenario:**
- Uses an `IPRotator` for source IP randomization.
- Employs a `PacketCrafter` to generate HTTP requests with varied methods (GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS), paths (including resource-heavy ones like search queries, API calls, large file downloads), and realistic User-Agent strings.
- Randomly adds common HTTP headers and sometimes cookies to appear more legitimate.
- Sends these crafted HTTP requests to the target, mimicking distributed legitimate user traffic.
- Variable timing between requests helps evade detection.

    G -->|No| C
    G -->|Yes| H[Attack Complete]
    
    style A fill:#fff3e0
    style H fill:#e8f5e8
```

#### 3. Slow Read Attack (ad_slow variant)

**Description:**
A Slow Read attack is a type of low-bandwidth, application-layer DDoS attack that aims to exhaust the server's connection pool by reading responses very slowly. The attacker opens a connection and then reads the response data byte by byte, or in very small chunks, over a long period. This keeps the server's resources tied up, waiting for the client to finish reading, eventually leading to a denial of service for new connections.

**How it happens in the scenario:**
- **Tool Used:** `slowhttptest`
- The `attacker_host` executes the `slowhttptest` command in "Slow Read" mode (`-t SR`).
- It establishes a specified number of connections (`-c 100`) to the victim's HTTP server.
- The tool is configured to read data very slowly (`-i 10` for interval, `-r 20` for connections per second).
- The attack runs for a defined `duration` (`-l`).
- This ties up server resources as the server waits for the slow client to receive the full response, eventually exhausting the server's connection capacity.

```mermaid

    participant h6 as h6 (Web Server)
    
    Note over h2,h6: Slow Read Attack (2 hours)
    
    h2->>s1: HTTP GET request
    s1->>h6: Forward HTTP request
    h6->>s1: HTTP response headers
    s1->>h2: Forward response headers
    
    Note over h2: Slowly consume response<br/>Keep connection alive
    
    loop Every 10 seconds
        h2->>s1: Read small chunks
        s1->>h6: Forward read request
        h6->>s1: Send data chunk
        s1->>h2: Forward data chunk
    end
    
    Note over h6: Connection resources exhausted<br/>100 concurrent connections
```

#### 4. Multi-Vector Attack

**Description:**
A multi-vector attack combines several different attack types simultaneously. This approach makes it more challenging for defense systems to mitigate, as they need to address multiple attack vectors at once.

**How it happens in the scenario:**
- Launches threads for different attack vectors concurrently, such as:
    - TCP State Exhaustion
    - Distributed Application Layer Attack
    - Slow Read Attack
- The `AdvancedDDoSCoordinator` manages the execution of these combined attacks.

#### 5. Adaptive Attack Coordination

**Description:**
The `AdvancedDDoSCoordinator` and `AdaptiveController` components work together to make the advanced attacks more dynamic and evasive. They monitor the target's response and adapt the attack strategy accordingly.

**How it happens in the scenario:**
- **Monitoring:** The `AdaptiveController` continuously probes the target to measure response times and detect potential countermeasures (e.g., rate limiting, WAF blocking, Cloudflare, CAPTCHA, timeouts).
- **Adaptation:** Based on the monitoring results, the `AdaptiveController` recommends optimal attack parameters (e.g., packet rate, connection count, preferred technique, IP rotation speed).
- **Execution:** The `AdvancedDDoSCoordinator` uses these recommendations to dynamically switch between or adjust the parameters of the TCP State Exhaustion, Distributed Application Layer, or Multi-Vector attacks, making the overall attack more resilient and harder to defend against.
- **Session Maintenance:** The `SessionMaintainer` creates and maintains legitimate-looking HTTP sessions to further blend the attack traffic with normal user activity.

#### 6. Advanced Evasion Techniques

**Description:**
To enhance stealth and bypass heuristic detection rules, the advanced adversarial attacks incorporate several evasion techniques:

- **Jittered Intervals and Randomization:** Packet and request sending intervals are randomized using `random.uniform()` to avoid predictable timing patterns that could indicate synthetic traffic. Source IP addresses, TCP sequence numbers, window sizes, and TTL values are also randomized.
- **TCP Flag Rotation:** TCP packets are crafted with a random selection of common TCP flags (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, PSH-ACK, FIN-ACK) to mimic varied legitimate TCP communication.
- **HTTP Header Rotation:** HTTP requests utilize a diverse set of User-Agent strings and randomly include Referer headers to simulate browsing behavior from different clients and sources.
- **Mimicking Benign Traffic:** The `SessionMaintainer` component actively creates and maintains persistent, legitimate-looking HTTP sessions, including navigating through various common web paths and handling cookies, to blend malicious traffic with normal user activity.
- **Payload and Timestamp Variability:** While explicit timestamp manipulation is handled by the OS/Scapy, the attacks introduce variability in payloads (e.g., varying query string lengths in HTTP requests) and manipulate TCP sequence numbers to ensure generated datasets do not appear overly synthetic.
- **Logging Emission Rates (Partial Implementation):** The `attack_logger` logs when packets/requests are sent, providing a basis for understanding traffic flow. However, explicit real-time calculation and logging of the precise emission rates (packets/sec or requests/sec) for verification of consistency and stealth are not fully implemented. This would require additional logic to track and report rates.

#### Key Distinctions:
- **Enhanced Traditional**: Focus on realism while maintaining detectability
- **Adversarial**: Focus on ML evasion and stealth techniques
- **Rate Difference**: Enhanced (~25 pps) vs Adversarial (~0.3 pps)
- **Detection**: Enhanced remain detectable by rate-based rules, Adversarial attempt evasion

### Attack Type Differentiation

**Enhanced Traditional Attacks** (realistic but detectable):
- Enhanced SYN flood with human timing and RFC-compliant TCP options
- Enhanced UDP flood with realistic DNS service patterns and ephemeral ports
- Enhanced ICMP flood with protocol compliance and enhanced monitoring

**Adversarial Attacks** (focused on ML evasion):
- TCP state exhaustion with burst patterns and jitter
- Application layer mimicry with IP rotation
- Slow read attacks with adaptive control

## üü¢ Normal Traffic Patterns

### Multi-Protocol Benign Traffic

**Description:**
Benign traffic simulates normal network activity to provide a realistic background for the DDoS attack scenarios. This helps in evaluating the effectiveness of detection mechanisms in a mixed traffic environment.

**How it happens in the scenario:**
- **Source:** `src/gen_benign_traffic.py`
- Various types of benign traffic are generated between `h3` and `h5` in the Mininet network.
- **Protocols Covered:**
    - **ICMP:** Standard ping requests and replies.
    - **TCP:** Full TCP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) followed by data transfer and a final ACK. This includes random payload lengths.
    - **UDP:** Datagrams with random payload lengths.
    - **Telnet (Port 23):** TCP handshake followed by simulated Telnet command data.
    - **SSH (Port 22):** TCP handshake followed by simulated encrypted SSH data.
    - **FTP (Port 21):** TCP handshake followed by simulated FTP file transfer data.
    - **HTTP (Port 80):** TCP handshake followed by simulated HTTP GET requests with headers and random payload.
    - **HTTPS (Port 443):** TCP handshake followed by simulated encrypted HTTPS application data.
    - **DNS (Port 53):** UDP-based DNS queries.
- **Traffic Generation:**
    - ICMP traffic uses Mininet's `ping` command.
    - All other traffic types are crafted and sent using the `scapy` library within the Mininet host's namespace.
    - Random source ports and random payload lengths are used to simulate varied legitimate traffic.
- The benign traffic runs for a specified `duration`, continuously generating sessions across different protocols.
